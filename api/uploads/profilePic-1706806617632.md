There are a number of algorithms available today.
set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
A set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

understanding when to apply an algorithm comes from understanding the problem - *algorithmic thinking*
- can break up the problem into small steps
- clear problem statement
- specify how the input is defined and hoe it looks once it is outputted
- the algorithm should be able to complete - and not be infinite - result needs ot be outputted
1. Clearly defined:
	 1. Problem statement
	 2. Input
	 3. Output
2. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
3. The steps also need to be distinct
4. The algorithm should produce a result
5. The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time 


- clearly define what the problem is
	-  figure out what solution is best for the given problem


- sequential/ simple/ linear search
	- start at the beginning and compare to the target - we'll move on sequentially to the next value in the list.
	- The specificity of how this is defined is why it is an algorithm
	- sorting is not needed
	- $O(n)$
- Binary Search
	- sorting is needed - additional work is needed for certian problems
	- > input of a list and target
	- > the output is the position of some sort of value that we're searching for 
	- logarithmic runtime - $O(log n)$ - sublinear
- Constant time
	- $O(1)$
- Quadratic Time
	- $O(n^2)$
- Cubic Runtime
	- $O(n^3)$
- Quasilinear - Merge sort
	- $O(n log n)$
	- split a list until we have lists of singular
		- then sorts this 
	- comparison operations - we carry out an n number of operations
- brute Force
	- exponential runtimes
	- $10^n$
	- n=2 (dependent on problem)

Big O
- Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size
- notation used to describe complexity - simplifies everythign into a small 
- (O(n)comes from order of magnitue of order complexity) - meaures complexity as the input size grows
- upper bound of hte algorthm - measures how the algorthm performs in the worst case scenario
- polynomal runtme worst case run time =  O(n^k)

Traveling Salesman
- find the shortest possible route that travels to 3 different cities 
- need to come up with all of the possible routes
- Factorial = $n!$ = $n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1)$
